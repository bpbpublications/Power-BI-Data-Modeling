# Power BI Data Modeling

This is the repository for [Power BI Data Modeling
](https://bpbonline.com/products/power-bi-data-modeling?_pos=1&_sid=d55bbf94d&_ss=r),published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book.
## About the Book
Creating data models has never been straightforward. This book demonstrates how to formulate a complete business analytics model that combines several data sources, executes numerous computations, and scales across hundreds of BI users.

To begin, you'll learn about the Microsoft Power BI ecosystem by downloading the Power BI desktop and exploring all of its features and capabilities. Through examples, you'll learn how to connect to databases of Excel; and SQL Server, shaping the data with Power Query, and then  transforming the data into actionable information. You will gain knowledge of the DAX language by exploring it, writing DAX functions, and creating hierarchies. You will be trained to develop effective business intelligence models by studying numerous data modeling topics.

You get to put professionals' best practices to the test when handling large data scenarios and executing analytics on top of them. Additionally, the book discusses how to scale Power BI while considering its storage, memory, and security requirements. You'll see that several new topics have been included, including performance tuning, DAX Studio, sharing Power BI reports, and publishing reports to Sharepoint online.

## What You Will Learn
•	Conduct profiling, cleansing, and transformation of data.
